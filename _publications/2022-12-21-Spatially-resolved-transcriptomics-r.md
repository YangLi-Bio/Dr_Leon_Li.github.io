excerpt: "The human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) is highly susceptible in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet its molecular vulnerability remains unclear. Using 10× Visium spatial transcriptomics, we profiled AD and control MTG, identifying layer-specific marker genes and differentially expressed genes. Cell-type deconvolution and gene co-expression analyses revealed altered intercellular communication in AD, particularly among microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Eight gene modules were detected, with four showing significant co-expression changes in AD. Single-molecule FISH validated the cell-type-specific expression of novel and known AD-related genes, providing insights into the spatial and cellular mechanisms underlying MTG vulnerability in early AD."
