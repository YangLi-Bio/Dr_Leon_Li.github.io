excerpt: "Chronic inflammation and impaired repair contribute to COPD, but the lack of accurate ex vivo models limits insight into epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Using an iPSC-derived alveolosphere co-cultured with fibroblasts, we applied transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to explore COPD pathology and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single-cell profiling revealed aberrant inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death, mirroring severe alveolar damage in COPD patients with COVID-19. The model also enabled testing of ACE2-neutralizing antibodies, confirming their efficacy in preventing infection. This 3D system offers a powerful platform for dissecting COPD-specific mechanisms and evaluating potential therapeutics."
