excerpt: "Gene expression imputation is vital for single-cell RNA-seq analysis. scGNN 2.0 improves upon its predecessor with a simplified closed-loop architecture, significantly boosting speed and performance. Across eight datasets, it enhances cell clustering accuracy by 85% (adjusted Rand index) and reduces imputation error by 68% (Median L1 Error). Built-in visualizations facilitate interpretation of imputation, clustering, and cellâ€“cell interactions. Additionally, expanded input/output support enhances flexibility, making scGNN 2.0 a powerful and efficient tool for single-cell data analysis."
