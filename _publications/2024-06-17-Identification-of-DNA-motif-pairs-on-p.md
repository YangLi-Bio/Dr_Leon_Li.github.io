excerpt: "We propose MPCHG, a novel method for predicting DNA motif pairs using a composite heterogeneous graph model. Unlike existing approaches that rely on single-motif recognition and suffer from local optima, MPCHG identifies motif pairs on paired sequences with significantly improved accuracy. The predicted motifs show increased DNase accessibility and functional consistency, and their associated transcription factor pairs are significantly enriched with known interactions. These findings highlight MPCHG's potential for uncovering DNA motif cooperativity and advancing our understanding of gene regulation mediated by long-range chromatin interactions."
