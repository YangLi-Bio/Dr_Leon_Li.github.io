excerpt: "Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a neuroinflammatory response involving microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which are hard to distinguish in vivo. By pharmacologically depleting microglia and applying histopathology, tract tracing, and bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, this study uncovers microglia-specific roles in SCI. Microglia are essential for coordinating CNS glial and immune responses, limiting tissue damage, and promoting recovery. Their absence worsens outcomes, while restoring specific microglia-mediated signaling pathways improves repair. Bioinformatic analysis further suggests that optimal recovery may rely on key ligandâ€“receptor interactions among microglia, astrocytes, and MDMs."
