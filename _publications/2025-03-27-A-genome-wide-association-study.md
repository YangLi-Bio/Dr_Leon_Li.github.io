excerpt: 'Plant height influences soybean yield and stress tolerance, yet its molecular basis remains poorly understood. A genome-wide association study using 6.7 million variants in a global soybean panel identified three QTLs, including one co-localizing with the known gene *Dt1* and two novel loci. Within these regions, nine candidate genes were proposed, with *VRN1-2* prioritized based on expression patterns and genetic variation. A non-synonymous variant in *VRN1-2* was significantly associated with height, and the short-height allele shows signs of domestication selection. These findings reveal novel regulators of plant height and provide targets for molecular breeding.'
