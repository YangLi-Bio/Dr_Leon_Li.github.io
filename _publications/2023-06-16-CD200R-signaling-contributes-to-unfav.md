excerpt: "CD200, an immune checkpoint overexpressed in many solid tumors, suppresses anti-tumor immunity. In CD200R-deficient mice, CD200⁺ tumors were more effectively rejected, accompanied by increased infiltration of CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cells, NK cells, and eosinophils, and reduced neutrophils. Antibody depletion confirmed the essential role of immune effectors. Mechanistically, loss of CD200R altered chemokine expression in tumor-associated myeloid cells, notably increasing CCL24 and eosinophil recruitment. These findings reveal that CD200R signaling shapes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by promoting neutrophil infiltration and excluding effectors, highlighting CD200-CD200R as a promising target for solid tumor immunotherapy."
