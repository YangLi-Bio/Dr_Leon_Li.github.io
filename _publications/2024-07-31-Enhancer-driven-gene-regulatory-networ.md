excerpt: 'STREAM advances enhancer-driven gene regulatory network (eGRN) inference by integrating Steiner forest modeling, hybrid biclustering, and submodular optimization to decipher transcription factor (TF)-enhancer-gene relationships from joint single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. It outperforms existing methods in TF recovery, enhancer linkage prediction, and gene relation discovery. Applied to Alzheimer's disease and diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma datasets, STREAM identifies pseudotime-associated regulatory dynamics and reveals key TF-enhancer-gene interactions underlying tumor cell mechanisms, including critical TF cooperation patterns. This approach enables precise reconstruction of gene regulatory programs in complex biological systems.'
